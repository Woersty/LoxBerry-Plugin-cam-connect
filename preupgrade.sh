#!/bin/sh

# Bash script which is executed in case of an update (if this plugin is already
# installed on the system). This script is executed as very first step (*BEFORE*
# preinstall.sh) and can be used e.g. to save existing configfiles to /tmp 
# during installation. Use with caution and remember, that all systems may be
# different!
#
# Exit code must be 0 if executed successfully.
#
# Will be executed as user "loxberry".
#
# We add 5 arguments when executing the script:
# command <TEMPFOLDER> <NAME> <FOLDER> <VERSION> <BASEFOLDER>
#
# For logging, print to STDOUT. You can use the following tags for showing
# different colorized information during plugin installation:
#
# <OK> This was ok!"
# <INFO> This is just for your information."
# <WARNING> This is a warning!"
# <ERROR> This is an error!"
# <FAIL> This is a fail!"
